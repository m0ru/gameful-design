## Converging

### influenced factors

* visualisations behind band (not on ceiling for safety reasons)
    * meter that pushes between the colors |=====>|<========|
    * avatars of audience and performers
    * band not visible? (focus on visualisation)
* 2 fractions at war (e.g. knights/angels/demons of different colors - red & blue)
* album / performance is a story
* lyrics & style change depending on which fraction leads (requires good preparation / band good at improvisation)
    * "good" wins: lighter themes / dur, fanfares, softer, more violin, crystal
    * "evil" wins: a bit discordant / moll, more drums, ...
*  the end of the story is decided the same way

* if factions are spatially separable / are to be determined by spatial position: project colors onto audience from above
    * people who know each other will be on the same team

### influencing the battle

via smartphone app:

* sign up to battle beforehand to one of the fractions
* configure your avatar?
* geospatial positioning via wifi/bluetooth-beacons
* gyro / micro to measure intensity of dancing / singing / clapping / ... (<- could switch between these at the artists behest with fitting labe/animation next to battle-bar)
* avatar is visible on virtual landscape behind band, moving at roughly the same speed and position as the band
* allows friends to compete

non-smartphone:

* pass out cheap bluetooth beacon + gyros (setup would do the localisation then)
* pass out "fate cards" (uv-glowing). Track them when they're raised.
    * would allow switching colors if they are 2-sided

### afterwards

@manager: data could be used to determine best songs / compilation

@merchandise: get album-cover with avatars of band & own avatar in center
