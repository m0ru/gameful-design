# Analysis of Settlers of Cagran

## Suggestions for Improvement

# Other Game Ideas

# Design Process

<!-- 

* 3 design sessions

what went wrong: 

* realized far too late that a paper prototype would have sufficed
* revisited assignment text too late (worked from memory of what had been told during the last lecture)
    * this caused a delay in coding -> we didn't manage to finish before the lecture

-->

# Effort Spent

<!--

Approximate total per person: 

* 18h over 3 design sessions
* 15h coding
* 4h documenting

-->
