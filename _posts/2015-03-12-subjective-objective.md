# The Challenge

<blockquote>gestalten sie ein kartenspiel, dessen ziel es ist, die auseinandersetzung mit dem »wert« von dingen zu provozieren bzw. fördern. »wert« umfasst dabei so komplexe konzepte wie marktwert, persönlich zugewiesener wert, unverkäuflichkeit, emotionaler wert, überraschender wert, situations-bezogener Wert, etc.</blockquote>

# The Design Process

3-in-a-row would be too easy

conservative introduction of mechanics (started with three colors)

coloring (memory game -> deduction/bluffing game)

double deck vs deck death

first turn advantage?

# The Rules

The game can be played with **two to four players**. Playtests where made with **two players** so far, thus this is the **recommended** number of players for now.

Every participating player gets a [**deck of cards**](
{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/media/subjective_objective_cards.pdf) with their chosen color (e.g. orange and violet in the linked pdf). Each deck should contain the numbers **one to four** in all of the **four colors** (yellow coins, green houses, red hearts, blue wrenches) **twice**. If you're printing the game, print the linked pdf twice!

As you can see, the card-set also contains **objective cards**. Create **two stacks** of these: one with the **numbers** one to four and one with the four **colors**. The objectives in each stack should be unique (i.e. every number and color should occur **exactly once**). Thus when printing, discard one set of objective cards.

At the beginning every player gets **six hand cards**. Pick a method of your liking to determine the first player, e.g. playing rock-paper-scissors(-lizard-spock). That player then places one of their cards on the table. Going clock-wise every other player then has to **place** a card **directly next** to that card (above, to the left, the right or below). This continues until one player fulfills at least one of their **victory conditions**, namely when **four** of **their color or their number** lie in a **row, column or diagonal**. If multiple players fulfill at least one of their victory conditions at the **same time**, the game **ends in a draw**. If you're playing several rounds and counting games won per player, give all winning players a point.
