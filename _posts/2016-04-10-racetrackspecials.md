TL;DR: A racing game, where you try to get your slowest team-member across the finish line first and can discover and do hidden jumping-and-bumping-challenges to activate special effects along the race track at the cost of occupying a team-member for a while.

## Basic Game

The basic game-play idea is taken from a fan-created game-mode of Project Gotham Racing as described in the [wikipedia article on emergent gameplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_gameplay#Changing_game_objectives). This mode, called “cat and mouse” people play in two teams. In every team there’s one person with a very slow car. The team to get their slow-car across the finish line first, wins. To do this, the players with the fast cars need to ram the enemies slow-car to slow it down or even knock it off the road―all the while protecting their own slow-car.

## Hidden Game: Activating Specials

As a hidden game-mode, there’s several locations along the racing track, where people can leave their cars to activate specials―if they find those spots. Examples ways of leaving the car would be:

* In a factory level: if you “fail” a jump and land on one of the conveyor belts, the driver gets picked up by a crane-claw.
* Crashing the car at high speed at a specific spot so that the driver gets thrown through the wind-shield
* Get flipped by monster
* Jump into teleporter-beam and get teleported out while car stays behind
* A garage or other parking spot where you can leave the car, reachable via:
    * A jump over a ramp out of the level at a specific point
    * A jump over a ramp at a cliff at a certain point
    * A camouflage net on a forest-map wall
    * Crashing through a window into a house

The huge trade-off should be, that the team sends a driver ahead to use on of these spots, looses them for attack and defense on the track. Also, timing is critical―drive ahead too early and lose time, drive ahead to late and you might be too late to activate the special. To increase the time-cost of activating the special, it should take a while to activate it. For this they need to go through a short jumping puzzle and knock a gatekeeper-boss off it’s platform. If multiple players rush for the special, they can knock each other off.
