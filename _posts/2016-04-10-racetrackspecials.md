TL;DR: A racing game, where you try to get your slowest team-member across the finish line first and can discover and do hidden jumping-and-bumping-challenges to activate special effects along the race track at the cost of occupying a team-member for a while.

## Basic Game

The basic game-play idea is taken from a fan-created game-mode of Project Gotham Racing as described in the [wikipedia article on emergent gameplay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_gameplay#Changing_game_objectives). This mode, called “cat and mouse” people play in two teams. In every team there’s one person with a very slow car. The team to get their slow-car across the finish line first, wins. To do this, the players with the fast cars need to ram the enemies slow-car to slow it down or even knock it off the road―all the while protecting their own slow-car.

## Hidden Game: Activating Specials

<img src="{{site.media_url}}/{{page.media_dir}}/racing2.png" class="figure">

As a hidden game-mode, there’s several locations along the racing track, where people can leave their cars to activate specials―if they find those spots. Examples ways of leaving the car would be:

* In a factory level: if you “fail” a jump and land on one of the conveyor belts, the driver gets picked up by a crane-claw.
* Crashing the car at high speed at a specific spot so that the driver gets thrown through the wind-shield
* Get flipped by monster
* Jump into teleporter-beam and get teleported out while car stays behind
* A garage or other parking spot where you can leave the car, reachable via:
    * A jump over a ramp out of the level at a specific point
    * A jump over a ramp at a cliff at a certain point
    * A camouflage net on a forest-map wall
    * Crashing through a window into a house

The huge trade-off should be, that the team sends a driver ahead to use on of these spots, looses them for attack and defense on the track. Also, timing is critical―drive ahead too early and lose time, drive ahead to late and you might be too late to activate the special. To increase the time-cost of activating the special, it should take a while to activate it. For this they need to go through a short jumping puzzle and knock a gatekeeper-boss off it’s platform. If multiple players rush for the special, they can knock each other off.

## Specials

<img src="{{site.media_url}}/{{page.media_dir}}/racing3.png" class="figure">

* Short-cuts
* Acceleration-strips
* (Moving) roadblocks that are dodge-able or circumventable.
* A tower that repeatedly targets and shoots at passing cars. Visual cues allow dodging the shots easily in a fast-car, but almost impossibly in a slow-car. Thus fast-cars should draw aggro away from their slow-car and ideally onto the enemy one.
* A teleporter that resets back to an earlier position or acts as a short-cut
* Pits
* Map zooms out to allow targeting an orbital laser.


For the special it turns out, that most buffs are more advantageous for the team who’s slow-car is behind and neutral if used by the leading team―e.g. a shortcut or acceleration strip stays activated for the slower team giving them the same advantage. Conversely agnostically harmful specials favor the leading team, as they can wait for their slow-car to pass-by it’s location before they activate it.

## Variants

* Do laps? This allows reversing.
* More or less team-members
* More than two teams
* Get out anywhere and build stuff, basically turning this into a full-on tower-defense mode with all implications (e.g. resource-management)
* At maximum one person per team can leave their car. Choose the special to go for wisely.
* There’s one overall engineer-token, that’s needed for specials. It changes hands when you’re getting rammed.
* Alternative puzzles instead of jumping and bumping―e.g. logic puzzles.

### Thoughts on the Mode

* In zwei Arten gewinnbar, die offensichtliche normale und eine versteckte Win-Condition mit Witz (e.g. Boss stirbt an Alterstot, oder Super Mario mit Rand des Spiels.) 50% der Spieler sollten nicht darauf kommen, dass es ein zweites Spiel im Spiel gibt. Die beiden sollten möglichst unterschiedlich sein.
    * most likely single player
    * most likely 2D
    * use elements / levels for something else
    * is a “glitch” that allows breaking 4th wall?
        * hacking minigame?
            * find a powered down terminal somewhere. power it up with a generator? Instantly “hacks” game.
            * allow executing commands “dr. eval”-style?
        * “glitch” out of map at some point?
            * suddenly top-down game?
        * coop game with two parallel levels - glitch allows switching characters to allow for different solution / finding a hidden level

    * try to reuse assets
        * mechanic-dichotomy creates deeper meaning
        * via‥
            * space
                * 3d where level flats out
                * 2d 90-degree turn
    * switch genre
        * glitch out of 3d-shooter, top-down map, rotate so there's a “down”, use map as puzzle plattformer
        * leave 2d, allows leaving the map


### Others Game Ideas

* racing with leaving the car, lay traps for cars?
    * you're suddenly frogger and can win by not getting run over. or: finish one lap as frog where all others need to do 3 laps?
* racing game with hidden adventure or 3d-plattformer story somewhere (e.g. peach-castle in mario cart)
    * unlocks items for rest of players?
* adventure game, find hidden terminal (of vanished culture), power up via some item from earlier level. god-level hacking (~“dr. eval”-style) to move through levels, get access to otherwise impossibly reachable content.
* 90-degree turn plattformer to racing game (mario to chasing the sun). concatenate all levels for this to have enough content?
* glitch out of 3d-shooter, top-down map, rotate so there's a “down”, use map as puzzle plattformer
* bullet hell without shooting. friendly fire? 2 factions? switch places?
* stealth game with freezes under scrutiny? animated household electronics? to break-beat dubstep?
* play two levels parallel, split in time (prob: only uni-directional - solved by [super time force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh4f30VVhbk))
* stealth game, but play guards
* stealth game, but play randomness (e.g. radio switches on to draw attention)
* visual novel but leave dialog somehow?
* mmo find a hidden storyteller that tells you a visual novel?
* plattformer where background can become foreground, obstacles become space and vis-versa.
